You can request our help to organize a live-streamed preprint journal club by clicking on the link above and filling the form. Here is a list of current and past LivePREJCs.\n\nLive-streamed PREreview journal clubs are:\n\n* *Inclusive*: anyone, anywhere in the world with a internet or phone connection can join\n    \n* *Informative*: you can learn more about the topic by listening to/reading the comments of other researchers in the field and even \nthe authors themselves (if invited)\n    \n* *Efficient*: if preprint authors are present, they receive feedback in real time. Also, we restrict the live journal clubs to 1 hour to \nkeep the feedback focused and efficient\n    \n* *Collaborative*: the format encourages contributions from all participants regardless of input style preference, *i.e.*, both vocal and \nsilent writing (etherpadding)\n    \n* *Fun*: even though the discussions are kept professional and centered around providing constructive feedback to the preprint authors, \nthey are a fun way to meet other people interested in the field.\n\n#### How to get started:\n\n1.

We envision PREreview as a hub to support and nurture the growth of a diverse community that openly exchanges timely, \nconstructive feedback on emerging scientific outputs. We believe that by empowering ECRs through peer review training programs, \nthereby increasing the diversity of researchers involved in the peer review process, PREreview will help establish a healthier and \nmore sustainable culture around research dissemination and evaluation.  \n\n## Why preprints?\nOver the past 30 years, publishing in the biological sciences has become a much lengthier process<sup>1</sup>. One way to separate \nthe sharing of scientific outputs from quality evaluation expressed purely by the opinions of publishers and a few peers, is posting \nyour manuscript as a preprint. \n\n[Preprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMgY8Dx9co) are early, yet complete, versions of scientific manuscripts made freely available online before journal-organized peer review. \nThey are often the same manuscripts that are submitted to a journal for peer review, but are stored on freely accessible public servers such that \nthey become available to the whole web community within 1-2 days from submission.  \n\nPreprints offer multiple opportunities to both train and diversify the pool of peer reviewers:  \n1) Research is available immediately, instead of being delayed for months; 2) community peer review allows for the feedback of a \nlarger and more diverse pool of experts;  \n3) Writing and sharing reviews helps train early-career researchers in the norms of constructive peer review;  \n4) As citable objects, preprints and their reviews can be used as proof of productivity and engagement for career advancement. \n\n## Why training researchers in peer review?\n\n* __Formal peer review training is rare and variable in quality__  \nIn our community opinion survey<sup>2</sup>, we found that only 18% of the respondents had received peer review training, even \nthough 72% had contributed to the peer review process. This suggests that very few scientists are trained when they write their \nfirst review – and even when they are, the training may vary greatly in quality. This is not only worrisome for journal editors because \nthey will find it harder to recruit new qualified reviewers, but it also denies ECRs the opportunity to learn valuable critical thinking \nskills from the early stages of their scientific training. Furthermore, ECRs are rarely invited to engage in traditional peer review. This is likely because they are either not known to journal editors or \nthey are believed to be less competent than more senior researchers at providing feedback on their peers’ work. \n\n* __Expand and diversify the pool of peer reviewers__  \nMany researchers agree that the current system of scientific peer review is flawed<sup>3</sup>. Research is evaluated by a handful of \nunpaid reviewers selected by journal editors as “experts” in the field. Two or sometimes three reviewers are chosen opaquely, often \nthrough personal connections. Behind closed doors, they decide the fate of a research article, largely basing their evaluation on \nsubjective criteria. Paradoxically, while peer review is a key component for scientific dissemination, very few scientists receive \nany formal training in it. \n\n  This arcane process is not only slow and inefficient – with waiting periods from submission to publication of six months or more – \n  but also disadvantages researchers from under-represented groups or under-resourced institutions. When they submit their research for \n  peer review, their work is evaluated using standards developed for research groups with vastly more resources and connections. \n  The gatekeepers to publication are disproportionately white and from the U.S. or Europen countries. Rarely is research evaluated by \n  a diverse pool of reviewers who can provide a comprehensive and context-appropriate evaluation of the science. Thus, we need better \n  ways to find, train, and engage researchers in peer review, and, importantly, we need to be intentional about including researchers from \n  under-represented groups in the design and leadership on any potential solutions. \n\nAt PREreview, we are dedicated to training a diverse community of reviewers, monitoring their progress and impact on the future of \npeer review. How will we achieve this goal? \n\n* __Cohort-based peer review mentorship program (coming soon)__  \nWe are developing a cohort-based peer-review mentorship program based on the successful \n[Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). Researchers with little to no experience \nin peer review will be paired with more experienced reviewers and invited to engage in community calls, webinars, and one-to-one calls. \nThe curriculum includes critical evaluation of preprints, strategies to help researchers provide constructive feedback, and training in unconscious bias, licensing, and leadership. \n\n  We are currently working with our community to learn how this program can support researchers from under-represented groups.

Peer review is a foundamental aspect of being a researcher. However, formal training in it is uncommon and varies in quality. \n\nADD PARAGRAPH ABOUT SHADOW PEER REVIEW AND CITE GARY MCDOWWELL ET AL. 2019\n\nTo help you with the composition of your PREreview, here are 5 basic tips:\n\n1. Be respectful\n2. Be constructive\n3. Be honest\n4. Be clear \n5. Be coincise\n\n...\n\n### Quick template questions:\nBelow is a list of questions you can ask yourself while reading the perprint.  \n\n* *What is the main question the study attempts to answer?*\n* *What is (are) the hypothesis(es)?*\n* *What techniques/analyses do the researchers adopt to test their hypothesis(es)?*\n* *Why is this study relevant?*\n* *Write here any general comments you might have about the research approach.*\n* *Write here any specific comment you might have about experimental approaches and methods used in the study.*\n* *Write here any specific comment/note about figures in the paper (this could be related to the way data are displayed and your \nability to understand the results just by looking at the figures).*\n* *Write here any additional comment you might have (this includes minor concerns such as typos and structure of the manuscript)*\n\n### Extended peer review guidelines  \nUse the template below to compose a full PREreview report.  \n\n**Overview and take-home messages:**  \nWrite a short (1 paragraph) summary of what the main findings of the research were and how this work has moved the field forward. \nThis could take the following structure:  \n*“[First author] et al. have made significant advances in [x, y and z] by showing that … In addition, they have bridged the gap in \nour knowledge about how [process i interacts with process ii]. Although this work is of [significant] interest to the field, there \nare some concerns that could be addressed in the next version. These are outlined below.”*\n\n**Positive feedback:**  \nAs the goal of the PREreview is to support the authors by providing constructive feedback, your should include positive remarks \nto encourage future posting of preprints. Remember, the authors are human too!
